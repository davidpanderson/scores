IMSLP serves several user populations:

1) Casual uploaders

People who upload a score or audio file for an existing composition.
They'll need to enter some metadata - license, hierarchy tags, etc.
They could do this through a form-based interface
rather than editing Wiki text and templates.
This is how things work now.
This UI can be kept (or rewritten).
It could insert items in the DB rather than generating wiki pages.

2) Advanced uploaders
People who upload content with detailed metadata,
or who add or edit metadata.
E.g. publisher templates.
These people are trained in Mediawiki and the IMSLP templates.
They would - I think - be upset if the UI changed,
or if any of the medadata they've entered is no longer visible.
I think it's critical to let these people continue to
work pretty much exactly as they do now.

3) Composers
People who upload scores and possibly audio of their own compositions.
They're similar to casual uploaders.
They don't know or care about wiki or templates.
We can give them a form-based web interface,
which feeds into the DB rather than the wiki.

4) Performers
People who search for and download scores.

5) Editors/checkers

6) Advanced editors/checkers
