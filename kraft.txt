to make recommendations (e.g. scores you might like)
it's tempting to think that you need to collect your own data.

But might be also able to use "adjacent" data
    youtube video watches
        google sells this?
        price? level of aggregation?
        firehose problem
    concert programs:
        set of pieces that go together
    amazon as data source?

what are IMSLP's institutional connections?
    conservatories?
    music libraries?

IMSLP as
    library of new as well as old music
    music wikipedia?
    linkedin (music match)
    concert directory
    recording nexus (rather than youtube)

Hook IMSLP up to larger audience (listeners)

ecosystem around the score domain
    score editors
    DAWs
