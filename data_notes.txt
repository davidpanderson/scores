#fte:imslpaudio template calls sometimes have

...
|Thumb Filename=Contenu neutre.jpg|200px|thumb|left
|Misc. Notes=
...

But | is the separator for template call arguments,
so the 200px, thumb etc. are separate positional arguments.
I don't think this is what was intended.

Some template call has 'Date Submittedn 2' arg

Publisher info

The publisher_information field of imslpfile can have various values:

1) a {{P template call, e.g.
    {{P|Edition Peters|C. F. Peters|Leipzig||||6536}}

2) a {{P call, with other stuff:
    ''[[Haydn - Piano Sonatas (Martienssen)|Sonaten fÃ¼r Klavier zu zwei HÃ¤nden]]''<br>{{P|Edition Peters|C.F. Peters|Leipzig||1937||11261}}

3) A call to a publisher-specific template, e.g.
    {{HaydnPnSonatasPasler|1||No.10|}}
    There are hundreds of such templates.

It's important that we preserve and display this info
a) to uniquely identify the source of scores
b) to avoid upsetting contributors

Proposal:

{{P case:
    new table "publisher"
        id
        name
        imprint
        location

    new fields for score_file_set (populate if {{P used)
        pub_id
        pub_date
        pub_year
        pub_edition_number
        pub_plate_number
        pub_extra (e.g. the [[...]] in 2))

publisher-specific templates:
    develop PHP code that expands template calls
    create a new table "template"
        name
        value
    Note: mediawiki itself is written in PHP,
    and uses MySQL to store everything.
    In theory we could borrow their code.
    But it might be better to do it ourselves.
